### Project Description
The project is basically a platform that allow people to draw in random canvases which keep getting swapped at random time with other canvases in realtime 
It's completely built using react native.
### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
What if people want to see someone else's artwork and wish to contribute something of their own in that?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
whenever we start drawing the canvas will change rapidly within a random time range and we can see others artwork and let our signature be on it
